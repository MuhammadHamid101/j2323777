        <h2 class="head1">Rome, capital of Italy</h2>
        <!-- Information obtained from : https://www.britannica.com/place/Rome -->
        <p class="p1">Rome, historic city and capital of Rome, of Lazio region, and of the country of Italy. 
        Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.
        Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter,
        the spiritual and physical seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, 
        and a memorial to the creative imagination of the past. Area city, 496 square miles (1,285 square km); province, 2,066 square miles (5,352 square km).

       <h3 class="head1">The Fountains</h3>
       <p class="p1">
       One of our favorite parts of  visiting Rome is all the invaluable and detailed fountains. 
       Rome is home to some of the most spectacular fountains in the world.  
       Home to over 2000 fountains, Rome has more than any other city in the world from the monumental to the small drinking fountains.
       The Trevi Fountain is perhaps the most famous, a late Baroque masterpiece, and it is certainly one of the most beautiful.
       The fountain is over 85 feet tall and 65 feet wide, and it is adorned with statues, bas-reliefs, and cascading waterfalls.
       People come from all over to throw a coin in, using the right hand over the left shoulder, in hopes of returning to the Eternal City.

           <h3 class="head1">Architecture</h3>
       <p class="p1">
           If you have ever heard the expression “Rome wasn&apos;t built in a day”, it is nothing short of mind-blowing to consider that thousands of years ago, Romans were able to build such stunning and timeless structures. 
           You cannot think of Roman architecture without thinking of the world-famous Roman Colosseum, aqueducts, Roman Baths, basilicas, and cathedrals.</p>

       <p class="p1">There are also unexplainable feats of architecture. The Pantheon is a masterpiece, built in the 120s AD.  It is the largest free-standing concrete dome in the world, and nobody has been able to figure out how it exists as it does.
       The architecture was important in unifying the Roman empire. Even more impressive, is the impact that Rome has had on architecture across the globe. Today, even in the US, many of the official buildings are influenced by Roman architecture.

       <h3 class="head1">Climate</h3>
       <p class="p1">
           Rome&apos;s hot, dry summer days, with high temperatures often above 75 °F (24 °C), are frequently cooled in the afternoons by the ponentino, a west wind that rises from the Tyrrhenian Sea.
           The city receives roughly 30 inches (750 mm) of precipitation annually; spring and autumn are the rainiest seasons.
           Frosts and occasional light snowfalls punctuate the otherwise mild winters, when high temperatures average just above 50 °F (10 °C). 
           The tramontana, a cold, dry wind from the north, frequents the city in the winter. Check out the current weather in Rome <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/it/rome/213490/weather-forecast/213490" target="_blank">here</a>.
